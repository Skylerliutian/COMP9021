Sir Camila goes for a walk with Sir Madeline on mondays. On tuesdays, Sir Camila goes for a walk with Sirs Fiona and Maggie. All know Sir Josie very well. On a sunday, Sir Juliet said: "at least one of us is a Knight."

On a saturday, it happened that "at least one of us is a Knave," was claimed by Sir Fiona. "Sir Annabelle and I are Knaves," asserted Sir Josie. As for Sir Jessica, it did not take her long to admit that "Sir Jessica, Sir Carol or Sir Annabelle is a Knight," on a thursday.
